== Description ==
- MailChimp for WooCommerce is a free plugin that connects your WooCommerce store with your MailChimp account.
- Your customers and their purchase data are automatically synced with MailChimp, so you can create targeted email campaigns based on buying behavior.

You’ll have the power to:

- Sync list and purchase data
- Create abandoned cart Automation workflows
- Send product recommendations
- Segment based on purchase history
- View your results and measure ROI
- Grow your audience and sell more stuff with Facebook Ad Campaigns in MailChimp

###A note for current WooCommerce integration users
This plugin supports our most powerful API 3.0 features, and is intended for users who have not yet integrated their WooCommerce stores with MailChimp.

You can run this new integration at the same time as your current WooCommerce integration for MailChimp. However, data from the older integration will display separately in subscriber profiles, and can’t be used with e-commerce features that require API 3.0.

== Installation ==
###Before You Start
Here are some things to know before you begin this process.

- This plugin requires you to have the [WooCommerce plugin](https://woocommerce.com/) already installed and activated in WordPress.
- Your hosting environment must meet [WooCommerce's minimum requirements](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements), including PHP 5.6 or greater.
- We recommend you use this plugin in a staging environment before installing it on production servers. To learn more about staging environments, [check out these related Wordpress plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=staging).
- MailChimp for WooCommerce syncs the customer’s first name, last name, email address, and orders.
- WooCommerce customers who haven't signed up for marketing emails will appear in the **Transactional** portion of your list, and cannot be exported. 

###Task Roadmap
You’ll need to do a few things to connect your WooCommerce store to MailChimp. 

- Download the plugin.
- Install the plugin on your WordPress Admin site.
- Connect the plugin with your MailChimp API Key.
- Configure your list settings to complete the data sync process.
